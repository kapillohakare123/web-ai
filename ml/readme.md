# Steps for Machine Learning Workflow

Follow these steps to build and deploy a machine learning model:

1. **Import the Data**  
   Load the dataset into your environment for analysis and processing.

2. **Clean the Data**  
   Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess the data to ensure quality.

3. **Split the Data into Training and Test Sets**  
   Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.

4. **Create a Model**  
   Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm and define the model architecture.

5. **Train the Model**  
   Fit the model to the training data and optimize its parameters.

6. **Make Predictions**  
   Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.

7. **Evaluate the Model** _(Optional)_  
   Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

8. **Deploy the Model** _(Optional)_  
   Integrate the model into a production environment for real-world use.
